Yorkshire
---------

üê∂ Yorkshire is your friend; Yorkshire checks Python's requirements files for a
possible dependency confusion.

Note if `PEP-708: Extending the Repository API to Mitigate Dependency Confusion
Attacks
<https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-708-extending-the-repository-api-to-mitigate-dependency-confusion-attacks/24179>`__
gets accepted, you do not need to use Yorkshire anymore.

The tool checks whether there are configured any extra index URLs in
corresponding files. Currently, there are supported the following installation
methods and their files:

* `PDM <https://pdm.fming.dev/>`__ - ``pyproject.toml`` and ``pdm.lock``
* `Pipenv <https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ - ``Pipfile`` and ``Pipfile.lock``
* `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__ - ``pyproject.toml`` (poetry.lock is not sufficient for a dependency confusion detection)
* `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ - raw ``requirements.txt``
* `pip-tools <https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/>`__ - ``requirements.txt`` and ``requirements.in``
* `setup.cfg <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html>`__ - the tool parses setuptool's ``setup.cfg`` configuration
* `setup.py <https://setuptools.pypa.io/>`__ - the tool statically analyzes sources of the ``setup.py`` script
